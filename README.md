If you are a serious gardener, you know the importance of a good potting soil. You likely have your favorite brand: one that you think has made your flowers bloom longer, your vegetables grow bigger, and your beds stay healthier. Big-name potting soil manufacturers offer mixes that grow "twice as big" or are made specifically for a type of plant or container or raised bed. But most often you'll see some form of moisture control options touting "protection against over & underwatering". And what makes that claim possible? For most potting soils: sphagnum peat moss.

Peat for use in horticulture comes primarily from Germany and Canada, according to the International Peatland Society. Peat is used for its water retention ability as well as its ability to help reduce nutrient drainage out of the soil. But when we remove it from the land to put it in our pots, we account "for over 70% of greenhouse gas emissions from peat used in horticulture."

Peatlands, which include bogs (fed by precipitation only) and fens (also fed through groundwater), are found in only 2.83% of the Earth's land surface. Worldwide, peatlands are drained and burned for their peat where it's most commonly used as an energy source or a growing medium.

Ohio is lucky enough to have a rare National Natural Landscape, Brown's Lake Bog, which contains a floating sphagnum moss mat. It was protected in 1967 "in a region where wetlands have been drained for agricultural use."

# About the Project 
This project was made using Scrollama for the Lede Program at Columbia University. It examines local options for buying peat-free potting soil in the once "Rose Capital of the World," so named for number of greenhouses and nurseries once found at the 'last stop' on the old National Road.

### The idea of this project could extend to any local newsroom. While the story of peat's importance in combating climate change has been told, the story put forth here could provide local news organizations with a way to encourage garden centers in their area to begin providing peat-free potting soil options. 

The data was collected in-person in July 2023 for this project. Potential future analysis includes image classification on Google search results comparing "peat-free" results with actual results, monitoring price fluctuations for organic and peat-free options, and local peatland preservation efforts.
